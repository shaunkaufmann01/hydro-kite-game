# Hydro game
(spell check not working(dyslexic)! also i used this to learn git)
This is a little game used to illustrate the power increase of a dynamically moving hydo kinetic kite.

Hydrosim does the physics (2D quasi steady)
uses 
- lifting line theory (moded with post stall charaturistics)
- actuator disk theory
- first order euler explicit time marching (with sub stepping)

rest is pygame
